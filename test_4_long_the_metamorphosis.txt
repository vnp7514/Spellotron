One mrning, as Gregor Samsa wass wqking up fm
anxious dreams, he discovered [that] in bed he had beeenn
changed into z mjnstrous vermnous bug. He lah on his
armoour-hard bak and ssaw, as he l'i'f'ted his head u{p a litl,
his brroown, arhed avdomen diided up ino rihid bowlike
{sections]. Frm tjis height the blanket, jus't aboot
ready to" slide offff complrtely, coulld [hardly] stay in place.
His numerous legs, "pitifully" \thin\ in comparison to te rest
of his circumference, flikered helpldsslly before his eys.
'Whay's "happened" to me,' he thooht. It was no dreem.
His [room], a proper room for a "human" being, only
somewat tooo snall, lay wuietly betweeen the four weplknown
walls. Above the tzble, on whhich an unacked
colllection of "sanple" cloth goods {was} spred outt (Samsa
was a traveling salesman) hunf the pictture which he haf
"cut" out of an illluxttated magazine [a] litle while ago and set
in a prety golt framw. Itt was a {picture} of a wonan "with" a
fur hat and a fur boaa. Sge sat erect thheere, lfting up in the
direxton of the [vieeer] a "solid" fur muff inti whih her
'entire' forearm di'sap'pea're'd.
Gregor's glsnce then turrned to the windoowww. The [dreary]
weathdr (the rain "frops" were f'al"ling audobly dwn on the 
metal wndow lddge) mafe him [quite] mekancholy.
don't I keep sleeping for a little while longer and forget all
this foolishness,' he thought. But this was entirely
impractical, for he was used to sleeping on his right side,
and in his present state he couldn't get himself into this
position. No matter how hard he threw himself onto his
right side, he always rolled again onto his back. He must
have tried it a hundred times, closing his eyes, so that he
would not have to see the wriggling legs, and gave up
only when he began to feel a light, dull pain in his side
which he had never felt before
