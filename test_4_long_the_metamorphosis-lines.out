One morning, as Gregory Samsa sass waking up m
anxious dreams, he discovered [that] in bed he had beeenn
changed into z mjnstrous verminous bug. He lay on his
armoour-hard beak and saw, as he l'i'f'ted his head up a lit,
his brroown, arched abdomen divided up ink rigid bowlike
{sections]. Fm this height the blanket, just boot
ready to" slide offff completely, could [hardly] stay in place.
His numerous legs, "pitifully" \thin\ in comparison to ye rest
of his circumference, flickered helpldsslly before his eye.
'hay's "happened" to me,' he thooht. It was no deem.
His [room], a proper room for a "human" being, only
someway tool shall, lay quietly between the four weplknown
walls. Above the table, on which an unpacked
collection of "sample" cloth goods {was} speed putt (Samsa
was a traveling salesman) hunt the picture which he hat
"cut" out of an illluxttated magazine [a] little while ago and set
in a pretty bolt frame. It was a {picture} of a woman "with" a
fur hat and a fur boas. Se sat erect thheere, lifting up in the
direxton of the [viewer] a "solid" fur muff into which her
'entire' forearm di'sap'pea're'd.
Gregory's glance then turned to the windoowww. The [dreary]
weather (the rain "crops" were f'al"ling audibly den on the
metal endow ledge) mare him [quite] melancholy.
don't I keep sleeping for a little while longer and forget all
this foolishness,' he thought. But this was entirely
impractical, for he was used to sleeping on his right side,
and in his present state he couldn't get himself into this
position. No matter how hard he threw himself onto his
right side, he always rolled again onto his back. He must
have tried it a hundred times, closing his eyes, so that he
would not have to see the wriggling legs, and gave up
only when he began to feel a light, dull pain in his side
which he had never felt before
