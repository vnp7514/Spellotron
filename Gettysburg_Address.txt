4 score and 7 years ago our fathhers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceved in Librrty, and dedicated to
the proposition that "all men are created eqial".

Now we are emgaged in a Great Cvil War, tsting whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.
We are met on a grat battle-field of that war. Wee've come to dsdicate a portion of that fied, as a final resting place for those
who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is [altoether] fitting and proper that we should do this.

Buut, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate- we can not conecrate- we can not halplow- THS GROUND. The brave men, living & dead,
who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our pior power to add or detract. Th world will liytle note, *nor long remember**
wat we say here, but it can nevwer forge what they did here. It is for us the living, rathe*, to be dedicated here to the unfinished
work which they who foiught here hav thus far so nogly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicatted to the great task remaining
before us- that from these honorwd dead we take incresased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion
-that we here highly resolve that these dead shant have died in vaim-that this ""nation, under God"", shall have a Nw Borth of
freedom- and that government of the pepple, by the pepple, for the pepple, shall not perish from the Erth.
